# Assignment 5 — Evaluating Predictors (CMPUT 267)

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for **CMPUT 267: Machine Learning I — Assignment 5**.  
The notebook focuses on **evaluating predictors**: loading data, training simple models, and assessing their performance with standard metrics and visualizations.

> This README is written to be repo‑ready (GitHub friendly) and assumes you’ll commit the cleaned notebook produced below.

## What’s inside
- **`Yusuf_ass5.ipynb`** — a cleaned copy of the notebook with stale widget metadata removed (avoids nbconvert errors).  
- **`requirements.txt`** — Python dependencies inferred from notebook imports.  
- **`.gitignore`** — ignores common Python/Jupyter caches, virtual environments, large data files, and secrets.

## What the notebook does (high level)
- Uses **NumPy** and **pandas** for data wrangling.
- Trains and evaluates models using **scikit‑learn** (predictors, preprocessing utilities).
- Produces **matplotlib** plots to visualize results.
- (Optional) interactive bits via **ipywidgets** (re‑run cells locally to regenerate widgets).
- Includes **Otter** autograder prompts/cells typical of coursework.
